Open up the animation folder from last time and find a .fbx file with animations.
Once that's done you can copy over the .fbx to the sampledata/models folder in the same way we did last time

You're likely going to need to rename the .fbx file here to only lowercase, numbers and underscores. For me the file is named air_drone_blend.fbx
Once that is done you're going to right click on the .fbx file similar to last time and choose Import Sceneform Asset.
However we're going to change one quick thing, for the output folder titled ".sfb Output Path" change it to src\main\res\raw. You can do so by clicking the 3 dot menu on the right and navigating to that directory.
Once that's done click Finish and let Gradle do it's thing.
Once Gradle is done loading you're going to open up the MainActivity file in the java class and change the line "modelLoader.loadModel(ANDY_RENDERABLE, R.raw.andy_dance);" to "modelLoader.loadModel(ANDY_RENDERABLE, R.raw.air_drone_blend);" 
Once that's done you can run the app and it should work
